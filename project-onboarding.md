# Mac Admins Open Source Project Onboarding

The Mac Admins Open Source organization exists to serve open source projects within the Mac Admin community which benefit from codesigning and/or community infrastructure.

## Project requirements

There are a few expectations that must be met to be considered for signing/hosting. They are as follows:

* Only the project owner can request to join the Mac Admins Open Source organization on Github.
* The project must be actively maintained
* Must be Mac Admin related (day to day, machine management, etc)
* The project must benefit from being signed, such as an .app or binary that needs to be scoped for a PPPC configuration profile.
* The project must be licensed with one of the following licenses:
  * Apache 2.0 (Preferred)
  * MIT
* All projects are reviewed on a case by case basis, and may be denied for any reason.

## Joining the Mac Admins Open Source organization

Once the request has been made, the following steps will be taken:

* The Mac Admins Open Source board will discuss the request and approve/deny within two weeks of receiving it.
* If approved, a private channel will be created on the [Mac Admins Slack](https://macadmins.org) to facilitate communication and complete work around this process
* The maintainer of the project will migrate the repo into the Mac Admins github org and the maintainer will be granted permissions to the repository
* Once the project is migrated, signed and all other work is complete, the project will be made public and will be announced in [#macadmins-opensource](https://macadmins.slack.com/archives/C0224B1QUSK) as well as various social media outlets.
